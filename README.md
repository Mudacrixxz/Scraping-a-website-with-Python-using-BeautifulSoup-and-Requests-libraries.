# Scraping-a-website-with-Python-using-BeautifulSoup-and-Requests-libraries

First of all what is web scraping, In todayâ€™s competitive world, everybody is looking for ways to innovate and make use of new technologies. Web scraping (also called web data extraction or data scraping) is an automated process that extracts data from a website and exports it in a structured format. But before scraping a website in python we need to install the python it self and then we need to install and import some libraries which are Requests and BeautifulSoup using command prompt, anaconda prompt and more. To install them we use this command:

```
#using command prompt
pip install requests BeautifulSoap

#using anaconda prompt
conda install requests BeautifulSoap
```

after we successfully install the libraries then we import them in order to use them for the web scraping:

```
#importing the required libraries

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoap
```
